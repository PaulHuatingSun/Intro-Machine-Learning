        "*Content/Trigger Warning: This assignment uses real-world data from Twitter, but that comes at the risk of our dataset containing tweets about sensitive or triggering topics.The tweets in this dataset do not reflect the views of the CSE/STAT 416 course staff. We have tried our best to remove some of the negative content but can only do so much when there are over 100k tweets in our dataset.This assignment should be doable without having to dig into the tweets present and reading about content you don't want to, but we wanted to give you a heads up just in case you do see something you find offensive.*\n",

        "This week, we will use the techniques for recommender systems in an unexpected way to help us model topics found on Twitter. In this homework you will practice extracting topics from tweets using matrix factorization. This method assumes every tweet is a combination of several topics weighted by their prevailance in the text. This approach in fact finds a low-dimensional representation of the tweets (through the topic weights).\n",

The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets-late-april?select=2020-04-30+Coronavirus+Tweets.CSV) and the preprocessing we have done followed the steps [here](https://www.kaggle.com/satanizer/covid-19-tweets-analysis). For computational speed we will analyze a dataset from one day: April 30, 2020. We encourage you to explore this dataset further and see how topics change over time.\n",

        "Before trying to investigate the values in the real data, let's do a small example first to explore how this can be done. You can use the [`argsort()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argsort.html) to get a list of array indices sorted by the values at those indices; this is useful when you want to use the ordered indices for another purpose. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the cell below, we have defined variables `small_words` and `small_weights` that correspond to a made-up example of words with weights from a single topic in NMF. To be specific, the word at index `i` in `small_words` will have weight `small_weights[i]`. You should write code in the cell below to make a new variable `sorted_small_words` that stores a `list` of the words of `small_words` but in sorted order from *largest weight* to *smallest weight*.\n",

        "*Notes*:\n",
        "* Pay special attention to the sort order specified by `argsort`. If you need to reverse an `numpy` array stored in a variable `a`, you can write `a[::-1]`. \n",
        "* Like normal, you should not hard code the answer to this problem but write code to make it work (even though you could easily do this example by just writing out the values). We want you to practice this now since in the next few problems you will have to do this on the real-data."
